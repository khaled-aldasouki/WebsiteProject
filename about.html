                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a Computer and Information Technologies student at RIT Dubai striving to become
                    a Software Engineer. I have tried out many different programming fields such as game
                    and web development, and look forward to learning more about them as well as learning
                    about new areas such as blockchain development and machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for programming and everything related to computers began early in my childhood
                    when I was first exposed to such technologies in both my personal and academic life, and 
                    as time passed that intrest only grew. I believe that the ability to program computers 
                    and create software is a huge part of building a better future and extending the limits
                    of human knowledge, which is why i also try to spread my knowledge and passion to others
                    and help them gain an understanding of how our future is being built through lines of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working as a teaching assistant at my university while also being the 
                    president of the programming club, while also working as a freelance software tester 
                    on the Testlio platform.
